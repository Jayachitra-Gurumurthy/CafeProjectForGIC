This is a MERN Full stack application 
Front end - React 
Back end - Node JS, Express JS 
DB - Mongo Atlas 

For running the applciation, follow the below steps

1. Open cmd prompt
2. cd <Your_Location>CafeProjectForGIC/Backend/
3. npm start (Please make sure you have installed node JS in your machine)
4. The application will be rendered at http://localhost:3000
   
Note: 
As I have added the static build files of react package into the server, no need for running any client to view application. 
The application will be directly rendered by running the noder server.
For Database i have used Mongo ATLAS (cloud based)
